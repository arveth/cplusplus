Repository for sample c++ code I wrote


I can't well into github yet so this one will be testing I guess? Hopefully I will learn how to properly github soon xD
And how one does add external files here? I already wrote some code that would want to put here...


DON'T TOUCH .PRO AND .PRO.USER FILES!!! EVER!!!!
